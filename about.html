                <p>I HAVE 4+ YEARS OF EXPERIENCE WORKING ON SIDE-PROJECTS AND WITH CLIENTS. ... BUT MY SKILLS DON'T STOP THERE. I'M CONSTANTLY LOOKING FOR LEARNING NEW THINGS AND NEW EXPERIENCES IN THIS VAST WORLD OF CREATIVITY.

                    I WAS BORN ON 29TH DECEMBER 2003 IN POITIERS, IN FRANCE. ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· .
                    I ALWAYS KNEW I WANTED TO BE A DEVELOPER SINCE THE AGE OF 12...
                    
                    BUT IN 2014, SOMETHING SPECIAL HAPPENED. I STARTED MAKING YOUTUBE VIDEOS AND KNOWING THAT I'M A BIT OF A STICKLER FOR DETAILS AND A PERFECTIONIST, I DESIGNED MY YOUTUBE BANNER AND VIDEO THUMBNAILS: THAT'S HOW I GOT INTO THE DESIGN BUSINESS.
                    
                    AS MY DESIGN SKILLS GREW, I THOUGHT WHY NOT OFFER MY SKILLS TO OTHER YOUTUBERS. THAT'S HOW I STARTED TO GET CLIENTS AND TO MAKE YOUTUBE THUMBNAILS AND BANNERS.
                    IN APRIL 2018, I DID A INTERNSHIP IN A WEB AGENCY (WEB IMPULSE). THIS AGENCY IS SPECIALIZED IN WEBSITE CREATION AND WEB DEVELOPMENT. THIS INTERNSHIP CONFIRMED MY CHOICE TO MAKE WEB DEVELOPMENT MY LIVELIHOOD. IT'S AT THIS PERIOD THAT I STARTED TO WORK ON UI DESIGN (IN ADDITION TO GRAPHIC DESIGN).

                    IN FEBRUARY 2019, I SAID TO MYSELF WHY NOT DO THE #100DAYSOFCODE (A CHALLENGE THAT CONSISTS IN LEARNING A LOT OF THINGS RELATED TO CODE IN 100
